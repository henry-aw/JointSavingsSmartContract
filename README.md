# *Module 20 Challenge*
## Joint Savings Smart Contract with Solidity

**Welcome to my Module 20 Challenge repository.  Here, you can checkout the Solidity smart contract I built to automate the creation of joint savings accounts, which uses ether management functions to implement a financial institution's reqiurements for providing the features of the joint savings account.  Find out more in the following sections!**

## Background
This project has been completed in two files. This first file is called joint_savings.sol, and it contains the complete code associated with the Solidity JointSavings smart contract. The second file is called Execution_Results, and it contains images that confirm theat the deposit and withdraw transactions, which are designed to test the JointSavings functionality in the JavaScript VM, worked as expected.

For this project, I acted as a recent hire at a fintech startup that is disrupting the finance industry with it own cross-border, Ethereum-compatible blockcahin that connects financial institutions. Currently, the team is building smart contracts to automate many of the institutions' financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, I created a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. My smart contract uses ether management functions to implement a financial institution's requirements for prividing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

Specifically, I assumed the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer in order to do the following:
- Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity
- Compile and Deploy the contract in the Javascript VM
- Interact with the deployed smart contract
